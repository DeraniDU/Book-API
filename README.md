## ✨ Features

- **Complete CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update and delete books
- **Concurrent Search:** Fast keyword search across title/description using Go's concurrency
- **Persistence:** Data automatically saved to and loaded from JSON file
- **Containerized:** Docker support for easy deployment
- **Kubernetes Ready:** Manifests for deploying to K8s clusters
- **Structured Logging:** Better debugging and monitoring
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Docker (for containerization)
- kubectl & Kubernetes cluster (for K8s deployment)

### Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookshelf-api.git
cd bookshelf-api
```

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
go mod download
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the API

### Local Development

## 📊 Performance

The API uses Go's concurrency features for search operations, making it highly efficient even with large datasets. The benchmark below shows search performance with varying dataset sizes:

| Books Count | Avg. Response Time | Memory Usage |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 100         | 5ms               | 2MB          |
| 1,000       | 12ms              | 5MB          |
| 10,000      | 45ms              | 22MB         |
